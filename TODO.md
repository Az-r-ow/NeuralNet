## TODOS :

- [ ] Work on optimizing the way files are including one another
  - [ ] Read about `inline`
  - [ ] Find a way to link only the necessary files for testing with catch 2
- [ ] Write some unit tests with the Catch2 library

- [ ] Implement mini-batch
- [ ] Implement more cost functions options
- [ ] Replace Quadratic loss der in lossDer function with dynamic function based on loss used
- [ ] Add cmake option to install submodules automatically during build time
